cpu:
inputs:
- clock
- *A
- *PC

outputs:
- jump (write R to PC)
- ram write (write R to *Ax)
- A
- R
- stop clock



decoder:
inputs:
- instruction

outputs:
- ALU opcode (5 bits)
- ALU A selection (2 bits) (see cpu doc)
- ALU B selection (2 bits) (see cpu doc)
- Ax address selection (0: A, 1: B)
- D selection (2 bits):
  00 instruction
  01 ALU
  10 A
  11 B
- write D to *Ax
- write D to A
- write D to B
- compare opcode
- compare operand (0: A, 1: B)
- write D to PC if compare true
- break
