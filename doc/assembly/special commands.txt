special commands include:


.bytes
takes in an arbitrary amount of hex-encoded bytes, and outputs them directly to the machine code.


.str
takes in two arguments:
- the name of an encoding definition
- double-quoted string of ascii-encoded text

the code generator converts each byte in the second argument according to the first argument, to a byte in the output.

the encoding definition is located in the arch folder. it maps ascii bytes to machine code bytes.

the string allows the use of escapes:
- \\: \
- \": "
- \u__ where __ is a hex-encoded byte: the byte
