Macro file structure:
```asm
This is arbitrary text that serves as documentation.
---
value1
value2
---
// This is asm source code.
cmd1 value1
cmd2 value1, value2
```

A macro file is split into three portions, separated by a line consisting of only `---`:
1. An arbitrary amount of (text) data intended for documentation.
2. The list of macro parameters, one per line.
3. The assembly source code. The macro parameters are defined as constants when parsing this.


A macro file can contain DEFINE directives but not INCLUDE directives. Any constants or labels defined in a macro will not be visible to any asm source code that uses the macro. However, any constants or labels defined by outer source code WILL be visible to the macro source code.
