the arch folder contains folders named after a hardware architecture.
these folders contain files used by the assembler when producing machine code for that architecture.



encoding definition
a file named: "${name}.encoding"

as described in `special commands.txt`, these map bytes from ascii encoded text to bytes in machine code.

each line in the file starts with a hex encoded byte corresponding to an ascii byte, followed by a tab character, followed by another hex encoded byte which defines the output in the machine code. optionally, another tab character followed by arbitrary comment text.

empty lines, and lines that start with a tab character, are ignored. the lines do not have to be sorted according to any logic.

if a byte is not specified, an error is generated by the assembler. if a byte is specified more than once, the behaviour is undefined.

format example:
```
	a comment.
20	00	space
41	01	A
42	02	B
43	03
```



instruction definition
a file named: "${name}.instruction"
