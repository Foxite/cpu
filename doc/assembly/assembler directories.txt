these folders are located either in one of these directories, in order of descending preference:
- as specified by a command line argument to the assembler,
- the current directory that the assembler is running in.

Or a predefined 'assembler home' directory. files found in the current directory take precedence over those in the assembler home.

the assembler home is any of these, in order of descending preference (an item is picked if it is specified):
- as specified by a command line argument to the assembler,
- the ASSEMBLER_HOME envvar,
- the directory that the assembler executable is stored in.
