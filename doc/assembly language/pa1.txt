pa1 (procassembly v1) is based on the language used in nandgame.

Its structure does not allow much extensibility with complex instructions, and it's pretty much stuck with proc16a.

It was implemented first, so that I could write a program that I could verify in nandgame and then test my own system against.

A working parser and assembler was in the repository but was removed after commit 9136b4f3 in favor of pa2.
