# globals: STACK_BEGIN, STACK_PTR
# description:
# STACK_PTR, lets say $0, is a memory address that holds the address of the top stack item PLUS ONE, which is initially STACK_BEGIN, lets say $256.
# when pushing items to the stack, that item is written to the address stored in STACK_PTR and then the value stored in STACK_PTR is incremented.
# when popping, the value in STACK_PTR is decremented and the address stored in STACK_PTR is loaded.
