# cpu
This is a homemade cpu. Or something.

Two 16-bit instruction sets (proc16a and proc16b) have been designed and a few computer designs that implement these instruction sets.

Directories:
- asm: assembly files
- doc: documentation
- ide: IDE related configuration
- schematics: hardware designs for [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/digital)
- tools: source code for assembler

A high-level language (or even full C support) may be added.
