# cpu
This is a homemade cpu. Or something.

There is currently one CPU architecture, the 16-bit "proc16a" and two designs that implement this architecture (proc16a1 and proc16a2). Different cpu architectures that I may add in the future would be named "proc16b" etc.

Documentation is in the doc folder. Schematics to be used with [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/digital) are in the schematics folder. Assembler and emulator are in the tools folder.

A high-level language (or even full C support) may be added.
