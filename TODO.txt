Tools
- Update tests as always
- An end-to-end test that compiles all test programs in v1 and v2, then ensures that they all have the exact same machine code output between v1 and v2
- What the hell does rslsvalue mean. Idk but get rid of that variable. You're mixing 4 conceptually different types, so use 4 conceptually different fields
- Want to remove assembler v1 eventually, but make sure v2 works properly
- IMacroProvider implementation that wraps another one, and caches the results
- Instruction argument validation with compile time safety (for AssemblyInstructions and InstructionAst)
- During assembly, AST probably should probably not be used anymore after an AssemblyInstruction list has been compiled.


Schematics
- The alu has been mostly unmodified since proc16a1, it's a mess, it deserves a major revamp. You can probably put everything behind one big multiplexer. It would make everything much more readable.
- Want to rework proc16b1 so that all registers are indexed in the same way, and the decoder outputs that index. This should make decoder output easier to oversee and test, and also remove some potential for electrical shorts.


Assembly language
- Remove star registers as a concept. It introduces a lot of unnecessary code. proc16a should define *A as %ma or something.


Programs
- Write stack machine
- Function calls for stack machine
- Pong
