Refactoring
- Update tests as always
- An end-to-end test that compiles all test programs in proc16b-v1 and proc16b-v2, then ensures that they all have the exact same machine code output
- What the hell does rslsvalue mean. Idk but get rid of that variable. You're mixing 4 conceptually different types
- Want to remove assembler v1 eventually, but make sure v2 works properly
- Caching in FileMacroProvider
- Instruction argument validation with compile time safety
