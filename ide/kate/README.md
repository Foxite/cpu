`pa2.xml` provides syntax highlighting for Kate. Place it in `~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax`.

`PA2%20assembler.ini` provides the compile.sh script as an external tool for Kate that can be bound to a keyboard shortcut, trigger, or menu bar. Place it in `~/.config/kate/externaltools`. You'll need to modify the path to the script.
