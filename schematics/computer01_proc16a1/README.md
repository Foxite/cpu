my first attempt at a working computer. it's a mess, but it's my mess.

it does not define a discrete "cpu". it also does not really have a sort of instruction decoder. it also doesn't have the ability to connect to any devices, as mapped memory is not implemented.

the lack of distinction between "cpu" and "computer", combined with the complete absence of wire tunnels, and very limited use of decorative rectangles, has earned it the description "spaghetti that I tricked into calculating fibonacci".
